# devin_shields_dot_com

I'm trying to host files for [devinshields.com](http://devinshields.com/) on GitHub Pages. I'm currently following the [tutorial here](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/using-github-pages-to-host-your-website), we'll see what happens.

[This guide](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) is the official one for setting up a custom domain. I'm looking at the DNS A Record guide [here](https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/).

Now testing the DNS redirect with `dig devinshieldsphotography.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd`. Not sure if I configured the A Record correctly...
